Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information. The entities communicating via symmetric encryption must exchange the key so that it can be used in the decryption process.
Asymmetrical encryption is also known as public key cryptography, which is a relatively new method, compared to symmetric encryption.
Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a process that uses a pair of related keys -- one public key and one private key -- to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use. ... Increased data security is the primary benefit of asymmetric cryptography.
Asymmetric Encryption is a form of Encryption where keys come in pairs. ... Asymmetric Encryption is also known as Public Key Cryptography, since users typically create a matching key pair, and make one public while keeping the other secret. Users can "sign" messages by encrypting them with their private keys.
